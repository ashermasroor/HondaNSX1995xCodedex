Submission for Cod√©dex 2024 Mini Holiday Hackathon
-
This is my attempt at a 90's retro themed personal blog website about my dream car, The 1995 Honda NXS-T
This was my first time programming a website from scratch which caused me to struggle with time however, I was still able to finish most of what I had planned and learnt alot.
